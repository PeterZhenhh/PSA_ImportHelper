# QuickStart
"psa_config.py" is used to separate skeleton config file generated by Umodel according to TrackNum to speedup ActorXImporter Loading. Just drag file "<skeleton Name>.config" onto it.If you wanna to export additive animation. Remember to choose "Force Animset translation" when Exporting. After that, you can use this plugin to fix that corrupted additive animation."https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv15685470/"
  
"psa_additiveShower.py" is used to show which animation use "additive" feature. It shows related animation to help you choose options in the plugin mentioned above.Just drag file "<skeleton Name>.props.txt" onto it.

"ActorXImporter.ms" and "export_fbx.ms" are my custom version of ActorXImporter. Use them after you generate many "<skeleton Name>.config" with "psa_config.py". It also solve the problem that overwriting existed animations with same filename by adding TrackNum prefix.

"AdditiveAnimsAlter.ms" is my custom version of additive fix maxscript mentioned above. Add a feature to batch export animations in different folders. To use this feature, edit batchConfigExample.cfg with this format:"PathToAdditiveAnim"+"|"+"PathToBaseAnim"+"|"+"1/2"(1->localSpace, 2->meshSpace).It currently only support using the first frame of baseAmim as refFrame.
